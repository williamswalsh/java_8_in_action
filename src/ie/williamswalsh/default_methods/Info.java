//    Java8 allows static methods in interface
//    Interfaces can now have implementation details -> which didn't happen b4

//    Default method is a method in an interface which is concrete(has implementation)
//    This method is inherited by a class implementing the interface
//    If Class doesn't override default method default implementation applies
//    If Class does    override default method specified implementation applies

//    Design pattern Collection Interface and Collections utility class to work with Collection Objects
//    Now Collection Interface can contain implementation code -> no need for "helper utility" classes
