Multicore CPUs have separate caches locking(Threading) requires that these caches are synchronized
this synchronization is slow -> costing a large amount of time

Behaviour Parameterization is the ability to:
- pass a function as an argument to a function
- returning a function
- incorporate it into a data structure

Interface Default methods
- Allows evolution of interfaces & libraries

Scala & Groovy run on the JVM

Stream:
A sequence of data items that are conceptually produced one at a time.
java.util.stream

Unix:
/Users/will/code/java/java_8_in_action/bash/unix_example.sh
cat, tr, sort & tail can execute in parallel
sort can process first few lines before cat or tr has finished

Stream methods should only accept functions that don't mutate shares mutable data
otherwise data integrity issue

Shouldn't use synchronised keyword with Streams

Functional Programming
- No shared mutable data
- Ability to pass functions
